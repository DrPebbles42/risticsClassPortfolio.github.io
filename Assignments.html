                <img src="Zybooks.png" alt="Zybooks Chapter 1 IST-110">
                <p>
                    In week 1, we focused on becoming accustomed to the Canvas interface and setting up the
                    tools that were needed to complete this course. We submitted a word document that
                    included a photo of the Zybooks subscription for proof that we had access to it. Zybooks
                    was used all semester long to track our readings by doing the reading checks throughout
                    the chapter. We also got access to Adobe Creative Suite to later create our Infographic
                    and possibly use to edit photos for this here portfolio.

                <img src="#" alt="Information Overload Depiction">
                <p>
                    In week 2, we did our first group project. In this project, each member found a scholarly
                    article that discussed the impact of information overload on decision making. We found
                    that information overload is a very serious thing that can cause adverse affects on individuals
                    that include but is not limited to: fatigue, neck pain, confusion, gathering incorrect
                    information, and severe stress which all cause poor decision making. Find all of the research

            <h2>Week 3: Binary Code Exploration</h2>
                <img src="#" alt="Binary Code">
                <p>
                    For this assigment, we watched a video, played a few binary games, and did our own research
                    to understand to uses and how binary is used. We the submitted a word document to be graded.
                    To summarize what I wrote:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Binary is made up of bits represented by 0s and 1s. 8 bits is called a byte. Binary is used
                    to store long and complex information inside of computers. It's a series of instructions for
                    the computer to follow. Using different codes, the binary code can be translated to human
                    readable language. This is no new feat to me as I've been working with technology for a few
                    years at this point.

            <img src="computationalProblemSolvingInfographic.png">
            <p>
                We were tasked with creating an infographic to either persuade the
                reader or educate the reader. I chose to explain and eduacte the reader
                on computation problem solving going through the concepts of decomposition,
                pattern recognition, alogrithms, and abstraction which you can find more

            <p>
                For this assignemnt, we needed to virtually take apart 2 different
                devices and create kind of a guide of what each of the parts were. The
                two devices that I chose to dissect were a Nintendo Switch and a Google
                Chromebook. You can find the powerpoint that I created

            <img src="#" alt="Windows vs Mac vs Linux">
            <p>
                This topic is quite controversial because there really is no "best" OS. 
                There is only the best OS for the particular user. Nonetheless, this
                assignment taught us to find the pros and cons of Windows, MacOS, and Linux
                for 3 different types of companies. Find the word doc

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <h4>Interior Design</h4>
            <p>
                The logical answer for an Interior Design company would definitely be Windows.
                I chose Windows because the industry standard for Interior Design is Windows so
                it natively supports many of the programs.
            </p>
            <h4>Social Media Advertising</h4>
            <p>
                The OS I chose for this was Mac OS. This is becasue Apple's ecosystem allows
                for the user to go between different tools.
            </p>
            <h4>Nonprofit Social Service</h4>
            <p>
                For this, I chose Linux because it is cost effective since it is free!
                There are many distributions that are Windows like for those that are
                not tech savvy. Using Linux also means that the nonprofit would only
                need to spend the money on the machines that the users are going to use.

            <p>
                This time, we went to 
                <a href="https://groklearning.com/hoc/activity/disease-epidemic/">this</a>
                website to practice very basic Python programming. We completed the first 3 modules
                of the "Disease Epidemic" activity. Find the finished results in

            <h2>Week 8: Data Organization</h2>
            <h3>CODIS Cold Case</h3>
            <p>
                CODIS stands for Combined DNA Index System. It searches across multiple local and
                national DNA profile databases and indices for potential matches. It is used for cold cases.
                For this assignment, we researched cold cases that CODIS helped to solve. To find my
                research on the Ernesto Mercado case, please click

            <h3>Music Genome Project</h3>
            <p>
                The music genome project is how Pandora Internet Radio uses metadata from each song to
                continue to provide music from artists that you may like because they are related through
                the music genre, collaborations, and more. For example, I chose iamjakehill and got songs
                that I already listened to. To find the assignment word doc, please click

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p>Structured Query Language is used to find information in relational databases. For this assignment,
                we used an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_distinct">online 
                simulation of an SQL database</a> to get used to running the SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE
                functions. To find the output of each statement, click

                articles and summarizing what those articles had to say about OSINT being valuable, and creating
                a final powerpoint deliverable to be graded. My groups reseach can be downloaded

                This week was yet another group project. We decided to do an infographic about the different viruses

                various activities such as Googling our names, using web scapers to see what kind of information can be linked
