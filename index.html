                Hi, and thank you for visiting my portfolio to showcase the work I have completed through my
                course at Penn State University. My name is Alex Ristics, an Information Systems and Technology
                undergraduate student. I have an Associate's degree from Johnson College in Computer Information
                Technology. Professionally, I have been a System Technician for 2 years. I'm very excited to
                finish my Bachelor's Degree!
                </p>

            <p>
                On a more lax note, I love to go hiking, play video games, and create video games! I think the idea
                of creating something out of nothing is a fantastic thing and I'm excited to showcase that in this
                portfolio. This portfolio will take you through a journey of all of the projects, assignments, and
                skills that I have aquired through this course. There's also a section to reflect on everything I
                have done. Let's get started!
