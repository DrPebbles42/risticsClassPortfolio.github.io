            <h2>Week 1: Course Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning the semester, we participated in a discussion to reflect on
                    what work style we are. There was a video to watch to learn about the 
                    workstyles found on LinkedIn 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/project-management-foundations-teams-3/work-style-assessment">here</a>.
                    The work styles included were:
                    <ul id="week1List">
                        <li>
                            Prioritizers: Logical, Analytical, and Data Oritented. They ask the
                            "What?" questions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Planners: Organized, Detail Oriented, Do things in a sequence. They
                            ask the "How?" questions to understand the process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Arrangers: Expressive, Emotional, Supportive. They ask the "Who?" 
                            questions to understand who is involved and what their roles are.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Visualizers: The big picture, creative people. They tend to ask the
                            "Why?" questions. They want to understand how everything fits and works
                            together.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                I identified with the prioritizer and arranger role at the beginning of the course,
                but I now feel as though I fit most in with the "Visualizer" work style the longer
                I've work in tech.

            <h2>Week 2: Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Week 2 brought a similar feel to Week 1. This time we were introducing ourselves
                to the rest of the class and explaining what interested us the most in IT. I
                already introduced myself on the home page, so moving on to the IT part. At the
                time of responding to this prompt, what interested me the most was Computer Science
                because I love to work with data and logic. I also love to code different things like
                games and automating processes.

            <h2>Week 3: Binary Statement</h2>
            <p>
                In Week 3, this dicussion started to teach us about to origins of computer languages.
                We translated 3 binary code strings using an ASCII table. The statements were: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Hello</li> 
                    <li>This is a binary code</li>
                    <li>I love data\n\n</li> 
                </ul>
                The way that I translated the statements was by looking up an ASCII table and then translating 
                it one byte at a time. The process was tedious and I'm glad that computers can do this in barely 
                any time at all. It's incredibly impressive!

            <h2>Week 4: Data Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                In Week 4, we started talking about data analytics terms. The 3 that we focused on were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Descriptive: Explain the data in a logical, concise, and informative way.</li>
                    <li>Predictive: Use the information to predict future data trends.</li>
                    <li>Prescriptive: Make decisions based on the data provided.</li>
                </ul>
                We were tasked to define our muddiest points and to help our classmates clear their muddiest points. I work
                with data, so none of this was really confusing to me except for the fact that I get the terms mixed up sometimes.

            <h2>Week 5: Exploring Computer Hardware</h2>
                <p>
                    For this discussion, we were tasked with answering 2 out of 7 prompts.
                </p>
            <h3>Personal Devices</h3>
                <p>
                    Hardware in portable personal devices such as laptops, smartphones, and wearables differ from a standard desktop 
                    computer. The biggest difference is, of course, the size of the hardware in the device. Laptop hardware is usually 
                    layered and is a great deal smaller than your typical desktop. Desktops will need (usually) a separate screen, 
                    keyboard, mouse, camera, and other i/o devices to make the computer usable. Laptops tend to come with these things 
                    prebuilt in which is a reason that a lot of people opt for a laptop nowadays (other than the portability). 
                    Smartphones take this a step further and now the capabilities of a computer can fit in your pocket. Smartphones do 
                    not need any external i/o devices to work properly and as expected out of the box. There is a built in speaker, 
                    camera, phone service, and (usually) a touch screen to navigate the environment. The boards are much smaller in 
                    smartphones as are all of the connectors and the components on the board.
                </p>
            <h3>Component Fuctions</h3>
                <p>
                    RAM is one of the most important parts of the computer. It is a stick of memory that is inserted into slots on the 
                    motherboard. RAM is a common culprit for windows blue screen of death errors. Having enough RAM on your computer and 
                    ensuring that it the memory on your device is not almost full is key to making sure that your device does not run 
                    sluggishly or start giving errors. So, how does it work? First, the data and programs are held in the HDD/SSD, thumb 
                    drive, or some other non-volatile memory when the computer is electronically powered off. Then, when the computer is 
                    turned on a program is started, the PC will copy the program from the non-volatile storage to the RAM, then run it. 
                    This is a great example of why the practice of actually turning your computer off (fully powered off, not just sleep) 
                    is so important. RAM is volatile memory which means that it is wiped every time the PC is turned off. Not restarting 
                    your computer sometimes will cause your computer to run sluggishly because the RAM is so full.

            <h2>Week 6: Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>
                This time we were writing a letter to either an OS or a program that we use and reflect on why we chose that OS or program. 
                We got to choose whether we were writing a love letter or a break-up letter. I chose to write a love letter to VSCode, 
                which is what I am using to create this portfolio.
            </p>
            <h3>The Love Letter</h3>
            <p id="letter">
                Dear VSCode,
                \n
                Thank you for being the one text editor with IDE functionality that I can always fall back on. We spend time together for at 
                least 6 hours a day while I'm working and sometimes even more time after that. The extensions that you provide make my job 
                easier. I love the fact that I customize every little token to fit my workspace aesthetic. The autocomplete from the beginning 
                is such an amazing feature that too many IDEs don't include. I can install extensions for any language I want to write in 
                without having to get different programs? Sign me right up 12 times over. Not to mention the community surrounding you? Every 
                time I have a question there's somebody who's already asked the question I had and it's so easy to find information! A 
                community surrounding a program that I use constantly? Wow! Amazing! Can't believe it! Jokes aside, you're amazing. I hope we 
                don't break up any time soon.

            <h2>Week 7: Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                For this dicussion, we once again needed to answer 2 of 7 prompts about programming languages.
            </p>
            <h3>Fundamental Differences</h3>
            <p>
                Machine language is the 0s and 1s that have been discussed prior. This is the language that 
                speaks directly to the computer in binary to give it the instructions needed for it to work the way the user expects. Machine 
                language is very difficult for humans to read because it's just bits and bits of binary. Machine language is written in binary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assembly Language is the language that is slightly more human readable, but unless there's a list, time, or someone who has 
                been studying it for a long time it's hard to understand still, especially with high level languages out there. Assembly language 
                is written in mnemonics (also known as symbolic names) to specify machine operations. This was huge because it meant that people 
                no longer had to work with the 0s and 1s. Assembly language is run through an "assembler" which converts the assembly language to 
                machine language so the hardware then knows what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                High Level Language is the language that's now most popular to be written amongst programmers. Some common examples include C, 
                C++, Python, C#, Visual Basic, and more. It is written in almost plain English following very specific syntax that is unique to 
                each language. These languages are run through a compiler which translates the code into machine language so the computer knows 
                what to do. 
            </p>
            <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
            <p>
                The easiest type of language to learn for beginners is a high level language. The most popular language for beginners is Python 
                because it's easy to read and write. It's a more forgiving language compared to others like C. Machine and Assembly languages 
                are much harder to grasp with machine language being the hardest. Machine language is literally 0s and 1s. I still stay away from
                binary as much as I can.

            <h2>Week 8: Exploring Excel Macros</h2>
            <p>
                Excel macros are used to automate repetitive or tedius tasks to increase efficiency. There were some pretty cool tools that my
                classmates found. I chose something helpful, yet small.

            <h2>Week 9: Unraveling The Internet and The Web</h2>
            <p>
                This discussion had us explain the different between the internet and the world wide web which are two terms that are often
                interchanged even though they shouldn't be. It also had us discuss what the roles of the two are. Finally, we had to answer
                two more prompts.
            </p>
            <h3>My Post:</h3>
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <p>
                Internet is the electronic communications network that connects computer networks and organizational computer facilities 
                around the world as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary. According to Cambridge, the internet is defined as the large 
                system of connected computers around the world that allows people to share information and communicate with each other. The 
                Internet is like the roads that communications (like emails) follow to go to another device. The world wide web exists on 
                the Internet. The World Wide Web is the webpages that we visit every day. According to the Oxford Dictionary, it is defined 
                as an information system on the internet which allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, 
                enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another. The Internet plays a role in global 
                connectivity because it is the network that people connect to to be able to access the World Wide Web. The Web brings 
                everyone to a place where they can share documents on the internet. It is the most common used resource on the Internet.
            </p>
            <h4>Underlying Technologies</h4>
            <p>
                The Internet uses many protocols to keep everything running smoothly. They are sets of rules that allows devices to 
                communicate with each other over the Internet. Every device that is connected to the internet has a unique IP address that 
                helps data know where to go and where it is coming from. IP addresses, which is unique to the device, helps the Internet 
                distinguish between routers, computers, and websites. The steps of an internet protocol are: dividing data into packets, 
                addressing, routing the packets, reassemble the data, and handle missing packets. Internet Protocols are needed because of 
                speed mismatches between sender and receiver to ensure that all data gets to the destination without loss. Some of the protocols 
                the internet uses are: TCP/IP, SMTP, PPP, FTP, SFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET, POP3, IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, UDP, IMAP, SSH, and Gopher. 
                The Web also uses protocols on top of the Internet protocols being used. Some examples of the protocols the Web uses are: 
                DNS and HTTP(S). Web servers are an important part of browsing the web. When the link is entered by a browser and the browser 
                needs the information from the Web server to be delivered, the browser requests the file by HTTP. The request is then received 
                by the Web server and accepts the request, finds the information requested, then delivers the information. Specifically, the 
                browser will obtain the IP address and the browser will be brought to the web server. When clicking hyperlinks, which bring 
                you to a specific piece of information on the Web, the browser will be brought to the requested page unless it no longer exists 
                which will result in an error message.
            </p>
            <h4>Global Impact</h4>
            <p>
                The global impact due to the Internet and Web is insane. Communication between people is almost all digital now. Face to face 
                conversations are becoming less common. More people are texting or using other social medias to stay in touch with their friends 
                and family rather than calling them or going to visit. Commerce has also never been more booming. If ta business has a website, 
                it is almost guaranteed to do better than if they are just open. This is because more people from around the world could buy the 
                product not just those around. This also means that advertisements are everywhere on the Web. People getting their educations are 
                able to do so without sitting in a classroom anymore. Just look at the World Campus option here at Penn State. We are able to get 
                our degree completely online without ever having to step foot on campus.
