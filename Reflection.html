            This class was a learning curve considering it is the first completely
            online class that I have ever taken. Before this, I was in hybrid or
            completely in person courses. This time, asyncronous learning was the
            backbone of the course.
        </p>

            Group projects were also huge during this class which was also something
            to get used to, but it was great to see everyone put in their effort and
            best work considering that we never met up for a call or anything and we still
            made some amazing projects.
        </p>

            Overall, this course was something of a refresher for a lot of the information 
            I already knew. It gave me another solid foundational class that went in detail
            without going too far in detail. The collaboration was awesome, and that was
            definitely my favorite part of the class.
